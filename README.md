# Data-Structure-and-algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on how data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently.

- Data Structures â†’ The way we organize and store data in memory (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).

- Algorithms â†’ Step-by-step procedures or methods for solving computational problems using data structures (e.g., searching, sorting, traversing, dynamic programming).

ðŸ‘‰ Together, DSA helps in writing programs that are:

- Efficient (faster execution, less memory usage).

- Scalable (works well even with large amounts of data).

- Maintainable (clean, logical problem-solving).

# Types of Data Structures

**1. Linear Data Structures:**

- Elements stored in a sequential manner.

- Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.

**2. Non-Linear Data Structures:**

- Elements stored in a hierarchical or interconnected way.

- Examples: Trees, Graphs, Heaps.

**3.Hash-Based Data Structures:**
- Use a hash function for quick data retrieval.

- Example: Hash Tables / Dictionaries / Maps.

## Types of Algorithms

**1. Sorting Algorithms:** Arrange data in order (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort).

**2. Searching Algorithms:** Find data efficiently (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).

**3. Dynamic Programming (DP):** Solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem).

**4. Greedy Algorithms:** Make local optimum choices to find a global optimum (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree).

**5.Graph Algorithms:** Solve problems on networks/graphs (e.g., Dijkstra, BFS, DFS).

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** How long an algorithm takes to run relative to input size (O(n), O(log n)).

- **Space Complexity:** How much memory an algorithm uses.
