# Data-Structure-and-algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on how data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently.

- Data Structures → The way we organize and store data in memory (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).

- Algorithms → Step-by-step procedures or methods for solving computational problems using data structures (e.g., searching, sorting, traversing, dynamic programming).
